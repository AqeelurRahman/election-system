Election System Project

Welcome to the Election System project repository! This project is developed using Node.js, Express, and Nest.js for the backend, and Vue.js for the frontend. This structure allows for an in-depth exploration of both server-side and client-side development technologies. The goal of this project is to build a robust and scalable election management system capable of handling various aspects of the election process.

Key Features:

Backend (Node.js, Express, Nest.js):

Leveraging JavaScript on the server-side for a fast and efficient backend.
Utilizing Nest.js for a modular and structured framework, enhancing code organization and maintainability.
Implementation of features for candidate registration, voter authentication, ballot casting, and result calculation.
Prioritizing security measures to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the election process.
Designing a RESTful API to facilitate communication between the frontend and backend components.
Frontend (Vue.js):

Building an interactive and responsive user interface using Vue.js.
Seamless integration with the backend API for real-time data retrieval and updates.
User-friendly interfaces for candidate registration, voter authentication, and result visualization.
Incorporating modern frontend practices for a smooth and engaging user experience.
